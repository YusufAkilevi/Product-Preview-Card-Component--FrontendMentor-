## My process

I built desktop version first and then went into the mobile version of the website.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

First, I design the html structure to use it to build the layout by Flexbox and CSS Grid. Then, I practiced Flexbox and CSS Grid to create the layout of the page.
I tried to stick to the design as much as possible. And also, I used media queries to respond mobile devices.

### Continued development

I want to continue to practice building layouts using Flexbox and CSS Grid with proper HTML structure and also work on responsive web design.
